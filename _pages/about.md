I am a third-year PhD student in Computational Applied Mathematics and Operations Research at Rice University. My research focuses on developing numerical algorithms for partial differential equations (PDEs) and integral equations.

I enjoy turning mathematical algorithms into efficient, reliable software solutions for scientific and engineering applications. My work spans a variety of methods, including Nystrom, spectral element, finite element, finite volume, and discontinuous Galerkin methods, with implementations in Julia, MATLAB, and Python.
